### The Lucky 4D Number Predictor ###
Have you ever wanted to know what the next lucky 4-digit number is going to be? Look no further! This fun side project uses machine learning and a neural network implemented with the Keras library to predict the next lucky 4-digit number.

We train our neural network on a set of historical lucky numbers data, so that it can make predictions on future lucky numbers. The prediction is made by inputting a set of features, and voila! You get your lucky 4-digit number.

## How to Use ##
First things first, you'll need to install the dependencies for the project, including Keras and TensorFlow. Don't worry, it's easy! Just run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now that you have everything set up, you're ready to make some predictions! Just run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jasonssl/lucky_number.git
$ cd lucky_number
$ python3 app.py
```

After you run the script, head over to your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000. This is where you'll see the predictions!

## Requirements ##
You'll need a Python environment with the following dependencies installed:

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Flask

Don't worry, these dependencies can be easily installed using the requirements.txt file included in the project.
